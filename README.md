A friend offered me 1000$ if I could get him the best modpack for FPS and QOL features. And since he offered my 1000$, you best believe it's one of the best modapacks for fps. 

### Simplicity + QOL features

This modpack aims to provide ease of access to everyone hoping to improve fps but also have some QOL features. The modpack incorporates the best optimization mods available to achieve max performance. And since most players don't just use optimization mods, we added QOL mods. For example, there is a mod that [display the time you have potions for](https://modrinth.com/mod/statuseffecttimer), [what durability your armor is on](https://modrinth.com/mod/ukus-armor-hud), and a [screen shoting mod that make sharing screen shots easier](https://modrinth.com/mod/essential). By including both QOL mods AND optimization mods, the 1000$ FPS modpack is an all in one modpack that offers everything a player could need to enjoy Minecraft.

### Adding your own mods

You can add your own mods and build on this modpack. But be sure to be careful of the compatibility issues. I won't be able to help with such issues.

- **[ImmediatelyFast](https://modrinth.com/mod/immediatelyfast)**: Speeds up world loading and rendering. Made by [RaphiMC](https://modrinth.com/user/RaphiMC).
- **[Dynamic FPS](https://modrinth.com/mod/dynamic-fps)**: Lowers the FPS when your game isn't running. It prevents Minecraft from using resources when it isn't being used. (FPS will be lowered to 15, don't freak out) Made by [juliand665](https://modrinth.com/user/juliand665)
- **[More Culling](https://modrinth.com/mod/moreculling)**: Makes sure that things you dont see, aren't rendered. Made by [FX](https://modrinth.com/user/FX).
- **[More Culling](https://modrinth.com/mod/moreculling)**: Helps prevent memory leaks so your memory can go where it needs to, your game. Made by [FX](https://modrinth.com/user/FX)
- **[Krypton](https://modrinth.com/mod/krypton)**: Helps with netowork optimizations. Made by [astei](https://modrinth.com/user/astei).
- **[Enhanced Block Entities](https://modrinth.com/mod/ebe)**: Improves the performance of block entity rendering. Also offeres a lot of visual improvement as a sidee ffect. Made by [FoundationGames](https://modrinth.com/user/FoundationGames).
- **[Concurrent Chunk Management Engine](https://modrinth.com/mod/c2me-fabric)**: This mod improves chunk performance. Made by [ishland](https://modrinth.com/user/ishland).
- **[Very Many Players](https://modrinth.com/mod/vmp-fabric)**: Improves performance when there are high playercounts. Made by [ishland](https://modrinth.com/user/ishland).
- **[Nvidium](https://modrinth.com/mod/nvidium)**: Uses MESH Shaders. Im going to get unprofessional for this one... This mod is one of the BEST mods for optimization. This can let you get up 32-100+ render distance WHILE improving FPS. The catch is that you must have a NVDIA GPU 16xx/20xx series or higher. (I'm on intel and I can't even use 100% of my modpack) If you do have a GPU compatible with NVIDUM, depending on how much VRAM your GPU has, the higher your render distance can be. Also, shaders don't work with NVIDUM and NVIDUM disables itself if you turn on shaders. Made by [cortex](https://modrinth.com/user/cortex).
- **[ThreadTweak](https://modrinth.com/mod/threadtweak)**: Lets you improve and tweak CPU Scheduling. Made by [getchoo](https://modrinth.com/user/getchoo).
- **[BadOptimizations](https://modrinth.com/mod/badoptimizations)**: Implements micro-optimizations which help improve the performance of Minecraft. Made by [thosea](https://modrinth.com/user/thosea).
- **[Noisium](https://modrinth.com/mod/noisium)**: Optimises world generation. Made by: [Steveplays](https://modrinth.com/user/Steveplays).
- **[Video Tape](https://modrinth.com/mod/videotape)**: Fixes GPU-related memory leaks. Made by [Anthus](https://modrinth.com/user/Anthus).
- **[Exordium](https://modrinth.com/mod/exordium)**: Renders the gui at lower fps. (can be configured) This allows your computer to focus more on the world rendering. Made by [tr7zw](https://modrinth.com/user/tr7zw).
